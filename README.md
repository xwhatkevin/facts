# Facts

This is a repository containing "facts" about different subjects you encounter in life.

* For a programmer, facts could be syntax explanations of tar commands, or high level concepts like what a rails fixture is.
* For a writer, these facts could be facts about fictional characters.
* For a human, it could be the preferences of a significant other. The new words preferences by a growing daughter.

I (@hakusaro) am attempting to collect data to better understand how people understand the world around them. I think that there are a lot of systems for collecting this information, but not a lot do it well.

If you want to participate in this project, I would like your consent to use the facts you submit in a curated way if I can use the data in the future. This will most likely be used in the form of "example facts" on a "marketing" site or a home page. They will only be used as examples of what people could come up with, and nothing more.

## What is a fact?

Well, it's not really a fact, exactly. "Fact" is just an analogy. It's more of a sentence or a sentence fragment that conveys a specific piece of information. Below are some examples:

* @Cats have 9 lives.
* @Sarah was born on October 22, 2022.
* To untar a @tar file, use tar xvf file.tar.
* If on @fire, use the technique "stop, drop, and roll."
* @Sword Art Online is a light novel series written by Reki Kawahara.
* @君の名は was directed by Makoto Shinkai.
* @Ash is a big fan of Takis.
* @Nicole saw her first meteor on October 12, 2038.

Note that facts aren't required to be true in the most empirical sense. They're supposed to be meaningful to you (thus being informative) and about a subject. They might be meaningless to everyone else, but the best facts are typically things only you can know, but might easily be forgotten. These can be things like people's favorite meals, flower preferences, or other trivial details about life.

## How do I submit these?

Submit facts following the template below. Make it called ```your-github-name.md``` in the submissions folder.

Make sure to at least give five facts about one subject. Facts are ideally not silly, like a fact that says "I love my @daughter." While true, it conveys no real information that couldn't be called obvious.

```markdown
* submitter: @github name
* statement: I hereby agree that the facts I have submitted are my own, and that I grant a license for Pryaxis Limited, or designated entities by Pryaxis Limited, the ability to use this data in a way to promote future Pryaxis services.

----

* First fact about @the first subject.
* Second fact about @the first subject.
* Third fact about @the first subject.
* Fourth fact about @the first subject.
* Fifth fact about @the first subject.

Second subject:
  * Fact 1
  * Fact 2
  * Fact 3
  * Fact 4
  * Fact 5
```

## What if a fact references multiple subjects?

The primary subject should be what it's about. That should be prefixed with the ```@``` symbol. For example, in this fact, you can identify two subjects:

* @Sword Art Online is a light novel series written by Reki Kawahara.

While both ```Sword Art Online``` and ```Reki Kawahara``` could be subjects, please don't tag the second subject unless you have five facts about it too. If you supply 5 facts about both ```Sword Art Online``` and ```Reki Kawahara```, then feel free to tag both of them with the ```@``` symbol.
